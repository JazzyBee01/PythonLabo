# PDF to markdown convertor
## Description
python code that converts all md files of a given directory and saves them in a folder while maintaining the structure of the directory.

## Remarks
- generated PDF documents have a watermark.
  - in an attempt to get rid of them I tried using md2pdf but this seems to requiere software GTK3. So did not continue using this library. Ignore 8_md2pdf.py. Use 8_PDFGenerator.py instead.
  - could parse the markdown files myself in the future
